//Now, let's set up the game loop and handle player movement:

function update() {
  // Apply gravity to player's vertical speed
  player.y += player.jumpSpeed;
  player.jumpSpeed += gravity;

function gameLoop() {

  draw();
  requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);
}

// Start the game loop

//Finally, let's set up keyboard events to allow the player to control the character:


document.addEventListener("keydown", (event) => {
  keys[event.keyCode] = true;
});

document.addEventListener("keyup", (event) => {
  keys[event.keyCode] = false;
});
